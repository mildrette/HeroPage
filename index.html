          Sung Jin-Woo (성진우) is the protagonist of Solo Leveling. He was
          previously known as the World's Weakest Hunter and delved down the
          path of becoming the World's Strongest Hunter after he was Reawakened
          and became a Player.
          <br /><br />
          Jin-Woo was reawakened as a Player after surviving the Cartenon Temple
          and completing the secret quest "Courage of the Weak." The mysterious
          System he received allowed Jin-Woo to limitless level up and increase
          his strength, unlike all hunters, who are unable to increase their
          strength unless reawakened.
